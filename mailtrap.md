# **What is?**

In simple words, it's an email delivery platform with added value regarding of testing, debugging, and control. Furthermore, it offers different security features suitable for intense email delivery (SPF, DKIM, DMARC). 

# **Why use it?**

It offers a delivery platform and a sandbox environment where we can test and control delivery without affecting production. A test email will never be sent to the end user if an automation workflow fails or a human error occurs. If a failure occurs in production (as recently), the Leverage Actionable Analytics feature will help catch and fix unexpected sending issues easier and faster.
